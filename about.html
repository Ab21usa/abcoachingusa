<h1 Style="color:blue;" > About My Journey! </h1>
<p style="color: navyblue;"> I moved to usa in 2000 with my family. I went to high school here and I continued my studies. I started playing hardball cricket in 2005 when I met a few friends in high school who introduced to local league. I joined a club called Stars Cricket Club in Division II. Soon I moved to Division I where I joined a club called Bengals Cricket Club. It was competitive and I begun practicing a lot more than ususal to get better at it. Later, I came across a few players who were playing for the USA Men's National Cricket Team. I thought to myself that maybe one day I can represent the USA Team. I remember devoting a lot of time for fitness and practice sessions. I used to go to an hour away to practice with players who were better than me so I can learn. I saw the improvement in my game in a few years as I was pushing myself to do better. I debut for the USA National Cricket Team in 2012. It was a long journey but well waitied. I went through the regional selection process and then played the national tournament and then got invited to the usa camp which shorlisted me into the 16 men's squad for the upcoming tour to Dubai in 2012.</p>
