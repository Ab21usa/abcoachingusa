<h1 style="color:brown;">About me!</h1>


<p style="background-color:brown;">I was born in Pakistan but I started my hardball cricket in the usa back in 2004. I do remember joining a few close friends from high school to play some pick up / parking lot cricket. Later I found out there is a cricket league. I joined Washington Cricket League in 2005. I played for a club called Stars Cricket Club in Division II. In short time, I gained more interest and pursed cricket full time. I moved up to Division to play for a club called Bengals Cricket Club. I started practicing with Elite players from my league to improve my game and push myself. I came across a few players who were playing for the USA Men's National Cricet Team. I started day dreaming about playing at the highest level in this county. I began competing and took my training very seriously to a point that I would not miss practices which jeopardized my studies for time being. However, I managed it. A few years later, in 2012 I went through all the obstacles and debut for the USA Team. I went on to represent the USA Team for a few years. My last tour with the USA Team was in 2018. In the excitiment of the Word Cup T20 in 2024, I have decided to make a comeback. I have started training hard on my fitness at a 39 years old. Stay Tune for the results. InshALLAH I got this.
